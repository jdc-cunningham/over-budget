So yeah right now I don't make enough to pay all my bills, I used to be a six-fig remote boy but now I'm a poor warehouse boy

This interface is something I designed a long time ago, where it shows you how much money you need per week.

Right now my warehouse job pays me every week so it works out too.

It's a modified calendar pretty much, although I made the calendar, I [made one a long time ago](http://cunninghamwebdd.com/projects/web-application/calendar/) actually with PHP one of my first projects

I am distracted... fatal mistake is turning on YouTube first thing when I get home, music is okay but YouTube just takes my attention away

There is this annoying high-pitch smoke-alarm sound that started a couple days ago and it's still going... I don't know why/what it is, it's outside of my building far away

I don't have the calendar right now/too spent, just want to make some structure/div

7:10 PM

It has also been a bit since I wrote some web app code, been working on the pi zero camera project

My fingers hurt
